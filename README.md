# Rogulike game (C++)

A repository with a game in the roguelike genre written by me entirely in C++. The only ready-made code used is pixel-by-pixel rendering of the image using OpenGL. The game is in its infancy, at the moment it is possible to control the character and move through several levels of the dungeon. The character dies when he steps on traps. In the future, the project can be finalized as a pet project.
